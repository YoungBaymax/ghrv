        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
          <p>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be defined as the variations in the sequence of periods between consecutive heartbeats, and it is regulated by factors extrinsic to the circulatory system. Variability is the result of a trade-off between the influence of the parasympathetic system (accelerating the heart rate) and the sympathetic system (slowing the heart rate). This relationship was experimentally determined by Aselkrod in 1981 <a class="cite" href="#references">[Aksel81]</a>. Since then, its clinical usefulness in various pathologies such as myocardial infarction, hypertension, heart failure, transplantation, etc, has been studied <a class="cite" href="#references">[Malik95]</a> <a class="cite" href="#references">[Task96]</a>. The typical HRV spectrum of a healthy person at rest is mainly composed of two components: a low frequency band (LF), from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz; and a high frequency band (HF) ranging from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz.</p>

          <p>HRV analysis has been a very active research field for the last twenty years. Distinct techniques have been proposed in this area, such as spectral analysis, non-lineal techniques or time-domain methods <a class="cite" href="#references">[Achar06]</a> <a class="cite" href="#references">[Chang07]</a> .</p>

          <p>At the present moment, HRV analysis has not been established as a standard method for diagnosis. This has conducted providers of medical technology at excluding this type of analysis in their devices, and researchers depend on software applications in order to apply additional processing methods.</p>

          <p>The common factor for all the algorithms aimed at helping clinicians in the HRV analysis is the fact that the majority of them have been implemented by particular investigation groups, which are forced to develop their own and proprietary software, due to the lack of a common software package, easily accessible and downloadable, that fulfills the particular requirements of each research association.</p>

          <p>To perform this task, many programming languages are employed, such as Matlab <a class="cite" href="#references">[MatHRV]</a>,  Java <a class="cite" href="#references">[Bogu11]</a>, or even LabView <a class="cite" href="#references">[Nati09]</a>. Other software packages alse deserve comment, such as the Kubios-HRV <a class="cite" href="#references">[Nisk04]</a>.</p>

          <p>Many applications can be found in the literature, including generation of correlated discrete ordinal data arising from longitudinal studies of medical research <a class="cite" href="#references">[Ibra11]</a>, detection of breast cancer <a class="cite" href="#references">[Roca12]</a>, population pharmacokinetic modeling for analyzing drugs effects and individual variations <a class="cite" href="#references">[Sun11]</a>, or time-series analysis <a class="cite" href="#references">[Koso11]</a>.</p>

          <p>Due to the growing scientific community developing specific software, and attending to the requirements of researchers, that usually need to unify software functionality into one open source and easily extendible tool, we have developed <strong>gHRV</strong>, a software package for HRV analysis (partially based on RHRV <a class="cite" href="#references">[Rodr11]</a>), in an attempt to help clinicians in the analysis of the heart rate. The <strong>gHRV</strong> software integrates partially RHRV as mathematical tool, but the user is offered a powerful and simple graphical interface. Central ideas behind its design are easy of installation and of use.</p>

          <p><strong>gHRV</strong> has been implemented employing Python <a class="cite" href="#references">[Pyth]</a>, based on object oriented programming (although it also supports imperative and functional programming), giving clean and legible code, which improves software maintenance. Besides, it makes a quite efficient use of memory and it is very extensible, thanks to libraries available to programmers. These advantages make Python one of the ten most used programming languages in this moment. Appart from these benefits, Python provides:</p>
            <p><ul><li>A high grade of efficiency and portability.</li>
              <li>Efficient and flexible libraries, which allow to implement a graphical interface, advanced mathematical functions and highly customizable plotting capability.</li>
              <li>Developing tools (IDEs or Integrated Development Environments, compilers, debuggers...) freely available for distinct operating systems.</li>
            </ul></p>

          <p><strong>gHRV</strong> is a simple and easy-to-use graphical interface, and guided interaction with the user is performed in order to minimize errors and functional problems. With this purpose, the interface enables or disables interactive elements depending on the state of the interaction.</p>

          <p>An important functionality of <strong>gHRV</strong> is the possibility to deal with different episodes (apnea, ischemia,...), creating or adding new episodes or deleting existing ones, and to obtain time evolution of power in frequency bands.</p>

          <p>The following main functionalities are provided:</p>
          <p><ul>
            <li>Heartbeats: file loading, automatic filtering, manual filtering and interpolation.</li>
            <li>Episodes: file loading, removing all episodes and editing.</li>
            <li>Frame-based evolution: time evolution of power in frequency bands.</li>
            <li>Poincar&eacute; plots: representation of the Poincar&eacute; plots of the RR (beat-to-beat) intervals.</li>
            <li>Significance analysis: statistical analysis of spectral parameters, in and out episodes.</li>
          </ul></p>

          <p>Details of the implementation and installation instructions are now given in the next Section.</p>

        <h3>Deb-based linux systems</h3>

        <p>To uninstall <strong>gHRV</strong>, open a terminal and use the command:</p>

        <pre>$ sudo apt-get remove ghrv</pre>


        <h2 id="gs:up">Updating <strong>gHRV</strong></h2>

        <p>Updating <strong>gHRV</strong> to other versions is an easy task that can be performed with the following instructions.</p>

        <h3>Windows</h3>

        <p>To update <strong>gHRV</strong> to a newer version, just make a new install. The installation procedure updates the program automatically.</p>

        <h3>OSX</h3>

        <p>Updates are installed using the same procedure as new installs. The system asks for confirmation if the new version overwrites the old one or not.</p>

        <h3>Deb-based linux systems</h3>

        <p>Updates are installed using the same procedure as new install with command <strong>gdebi</strong>.</p>


        <h2 id="gs:ki">Known Issues </h2>

        <h3>OSX</h3>

        <p>There is some focus problem in OSX implementation of wxpython libraries. The effect of this problem is that sometimes, just after running <strong>gHRV</strong>, new windows are not shown. Normally, clicking on the <strong>gHRV</strong> icon in the dock solves this problem.</p>

        <h3>Deb-based linux systems</h3>

        <p>If Linux version is called from a terminal, there is a warning (Gtk-WARNING **: Unable to retrieve the file info...) in the terminal when saving a new project. This is caused by the implementation of file dialogs in some libraries. Users can ignore this message since the file is saved correctly.</p>

        <h1 id="ugs">Using gHRV Software</h1>

        <h2 id="ugs:rg">Running <strong>gHRV</strong></h2>

        <p><strong>gHRV</strong> application provides a broad functionality related to HRV analysis, and can be easily and intuitively used, presenting results in a very illustrative and attractive way for the user. To execute <strong>gHRV</strong> just double-click on the corresponding icon.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure8.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Initial view for <strong>gHRV</strong></p>

        <p>Once the application is running, the appearance of <strong>gHRV</strong> is quite similar to those that can be present in other widely used softwares.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure9.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt"><strong>gHRV</strong> icon: double-click for executing</p>

        <p>On the left hand side of the window, several options can be selected. When starting <strong>gHRV</strong>, only several actions can be performed: the user can select to load either a project or a hear rate data file, by clicking the corresponding option. The remaining functionalities are activated either when data are avaliable or it becomes possible to perform the action.</p>

        <p>A detailed description about all the options will be given in the next Sections of this manual.</p>


        <h2 id="ugs:pp">Projects Panel</h2>

        <h3>Load</h3>
        <p> When applying heart rate analysis employing <strong>gHRV</strong>, a .gHRV project file, with a specific format, can be created and retrieved for modifying it in posterior sesions. To load a previously created project, just click on <strong>Load</strong>, and select the corresponding file project. As an example, you can download from the web page <a href="http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/packages.html">http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/packages.html</a> the file SimpleProject.gHRV.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure10.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Initial loading options for <strong>gHRV</strong></p>

        <p>If the file format is not accepted by <strong>gHRV</strong>, an error message will appear.</p>

        <p class="imgtxt">Initial project loading error message</p>       

        <p>When the selected project is retrieved, it can be observed that the <strong>Load</strong> options are all blurred (not allowed), and the <strong>Save, Clear</strong> and <strong>Settings </strong> options from the <strong>Projects Panel</strong> are now active, and can be executed.</p> 

        <img src="docfigures/Figure12.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">I<strong>gHRV</strong> project retrieved from SimpleProjectgHRVfile</p>       

        <p>In the upper left corner of the graph area, options for zooming or reducing the graph, or for displacing the signal points along the time axis can be observed.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure13.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Command options for excuting <strong>gHRV</strong> commands</p>     
        
        <p>These functions allow the user to manipulate the graphical representation and to exports plots that can be used in other programs. Exporting formats are jpg, png, pdf, svg, tif and eps (avalaibility of some of these formats depends on the operating system).</p>   

        <h3>Save</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Save</strong> option allows to save changes in the project, or even save it as a different project.</p>
  
        <img src="docfigures/Figure14.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Saving a new project in <strong>gHRV</strong></p>   

        <h3>Clear</h3>
        <p>For executing the <strong>Clear</strong> option, just double-click on the corresponding option, and a window will appear, giving the user the possibility of removing the project from the <strong>gHRV</strong> active interface.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure15.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Removing a project from <strong>gHRV</strong> memory</p>   

        <h3>Settings</h3>
        <p>Finally, <strong>Settings</strong> options should be selected when either frequency or window analyzing values are modified. This options will be explained when describing the <strong>Config</strong> option, in the <strong>gHRV</strong> panel.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure16.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt"><strong>Settings</strong> options panel</p>   

        <p>The project name can also be rewritten (not stored, for this option you must use <strong>Save</strong>). When clicking this option, a new window asking for confirmation appears.</p>

        <p class="imgtxt"><strong>Setting</strong> options panel: creating a new project</p>   


        <h2 id="ugs:hp">Heart Rate Data Panel</h2>
        <p><strong>gHRV</strong> is able to work with different heart rate data file formats: Polar, Suunto, ASCII (beats and RR series) and WFDB (qrs) beats files. As an example, you can download from the <a href="http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/doc.html"> http://milegroup.github.com/ghrv/doc.html </a> the file <strong>beat_ascii.txt</strong>, where data are in a single-column ascii file, indicating the beats position from a previously annotated ECG file.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure18.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Accepted format file for heart rate data</p>   

        <p>The instantaneous heart rate can be defined as the inverse of the time separation between two consecutive heart beats. Once the beats have been loaded, the heart rate is calculated. In mathematical terms, this corresponds to the calculation of the series:</p>

        <pre> <center>HR(i)=1000/[T(i)-T(i-1)]</center></pre>

        <p>where HR(i) is the instantaneous heart rate, and T(i) is the position of the i normal beat, measured in milliseconds, from the initial point of the file.</p>

        <h3>Load</h3>
        <p>To load a heart rate data file, just click on <strong>Load</strong>, and select the corresponding file.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure19.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Initial loading options for heart rate data files</p>   

        <p>If the data file format is not accepted by <strong>gHRV</strong>, an error message is displayed.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure20.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Initial heart rate data file loading error message</p>   

        <p>When the selected file is retrieved, it can be observed that the <strong>Load</strong> options are blurred (not allowed, except for loading episodes), and <strong>Filter</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> options from the <strong>Heart Rate Data Panel</strong> are now active, and can be executed.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure21.jpg" class="screenshot"/>
        <p class="imgtxt">Heart rate data retrieved from <strong>beats.txt</strong> file</p>

        <h3>Filter</h3>
        <p>Just click in the <strong>Filter</strong> option to obtain a filtered version of the hear rate data. This option can also be performed once for an specific signal in each sesion work, and allows to reject uncorrect heart beats, due to erroneous values of the instantaneous heart rate, distorting the result of the analysis. The algorithm  uses adaptive thresholds for rejecting those beats different from the given threshold more than a certain value. The filter also eliminates points that are not within acceptable physiological values. The filtered non-equispaced heart rate signal is obtained.</p>

        <img src="docfigures/Figure22.jpg" class="screenshot"/>

        <h3>Interpolate</h3>
        <p>This options allows to interpolate the heart rate signal, applying a cubic spline interpolation. The default frequency for interpolation is 4 Hz, even although it can be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option of the <strong>gHRV Panel</strong>, that will be explained in the corresponding Section of this Manual. A new heart rate signal adequate for performing the spectral analysis appears in the graphical window, preserving the episodes information (if existing).</p>

        <p><strong>Interpolation</strong> option is now blurred, and it becomes possible to click in the <strong>Frame-based evolution</strong> button. With this option, spectral analysis is possible.</p>

        <h3>Frame-based evolution</h3>

        <p>To perform power spectral analysis, the spectrogram of the signal is first calculated, employing the Sort-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), with a window size and a displacement value of 120 10, respectively. These default values can also be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option of the <strong>gHRV</strong> panel. Zero-padding of 1024 pixels is also applied. Next, the power in various spectral bands is obtained:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>VLF: power in the VLF band (0.03-0.05 Hz).</li>
          <li>LF: power in the LF band (0.05-0.15 Hz).</li>
          <li>HF: power in the HF band (0.15-0.4Hz).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These default values can be modified in the <strong>Config</strong> option from the <strong>gHRV</strong> panel. Other parameters are also provided:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>LF/HF ratio: defined as the ratio for the LF and the HF bands.</li>
          <li>Power: total value for the spectral power.</li>
          <li>Mean HR: mean heart rate value.</li>
          <li>HR STD: corresponding standard deviation.</li>
          <li>pNN50: percentage of differences between adjacent intervals that are >50 msec.</li>
          <li>rMSSD: square root of the mean of the squares of the differences between adjacent intervals.</li>
          <li>ApEn: approximate entropy.</li>
          <li>FracDim: fractal dimension. </li>
          <li>Heart rate: data employed to perform the analysis.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For performing spectral analysis, just click the <strong>Frame-based evolution </strong> option, and a window indicating the calculation process in progress will appear.</p>
